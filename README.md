# OBS YouTube Playlist Player

## URL (playlist param required)
```
https://<user>.github.io/obs-youtube-player/?playlist=YOUR_PLAYLIST_ID&volume=75
```
- `playlist` is **required** (ID from the YouTube URL after `list=`).
- `volume` is optional (0â€“100, default 50).

## Notes
- No playlist ID is hardcoded in the code.
- Player remembers index + time per `playlist` on each machine via localStorage.
- HTTPS origin (Pages) avoids YouTube error 153.
